# EG-247 Signals and Systems

## Lab Portfolio

This part of the repository contains a template for the EG-247 lab portfolio.

The directory structure follows the structure recommended in the [marking
scheme](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AljOJ7w63DbTdERaUkhYako2V3VEemdabnd6angxSEE&usp=sharing) and the folders contain copies of the starter files needed for
each lab exercise and empty files for those documents that you are
expected to contribute yourself.

I will use the statistics generated from this structure to help me to
assess your work without having to audit every file.

The file `model_audit.txt` will form the basis of my check.
