# Lesson 1

## Homework

Consider the signal $f(t)$

$$x = f(t) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0\;:\;t <  - 1}\\
{t + 1\;:\; - 1 \le t \le 1}\\
{0\;:\;t > 1}
\end{array}} \right.$$

which you sketched during lesson 1.

Think about the effect on this signal of applying the following basic signal
operations:

* $2 f(t)$
* $0.5 f(t)$
* $f(2t)$
* $f(0.5 t)$
* $-f(t)$
* $f(-t)$
* $-f(-t)$
* $f(t - 1)$
* $f(t + 1)$
* $-2f(-t+2)$

Sketch the results in the post-class activities page. We will go through these at
the start of lesson 2 and you can compare your answers with mine then.
